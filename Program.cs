    //CompareTo compares two strings based on based on alphabetical (lexicographical) order, or using the Unicode values of the characters. However, C# performs culture-senstive comparison meaning that in some cultures, A (65) is greater than a (97).

In many cultures, when sorting strings, uppercase letters are considered "lesser" than lowercase letters, particularly when comparing the same characters in different cases. For example, when comparing "apple" (calling string) to "Apple" (argument), the system treats the uppercase "A" as coming before the lowercase "a," resulting in -1 (since "Apple" comes before "apple" in the order of comparison).
